Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## Key Concepts

- **Code**: The instructions written in a programming language.
- **Source Code**: The human-readable code written by a programmer.
- **Machine Code**: The binary code (0s and 1s) that the computer hardware actually executes.
- **Compiler/Interpreter**: Tools that translate source code into machine code.

## Why Learn Programming?

1. **Problem Solving**: Programming teaches you how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
2. **Automation**: You can automate repetitive tasks.
3. **Creativity**: You can build software, games, websites, and apps.
