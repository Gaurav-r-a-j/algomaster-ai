# Flowcharts

A flowchart is a visual representation of an algorithm or process. It uses standard symbols to illustrate the flow of control.

## Common Symbols

- **Oval (Start/End)**: Represents the beginning or end of a process.
- **Parallelogram (Input/Output)**: Represents input data or output results.
- **Rectangle (Process)**: Represents a processing step or calculation.
- **Diamond (Decision)**: Represents a decision point (Yes/No).
- **Arrows**: Indicate the direction of the flow.

## Example

Imagine a flowchart for checking if a number is even:
1. Start
2. Input Number `n`
3. Is `n % 2 == 0`?
    - Yes -> Print "Even"
    - No -> Print "Odd"
4. End
