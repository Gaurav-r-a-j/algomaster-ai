# Algorithms & Pseudocode

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end.

### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm

1. **Unambiguous**: Each step must be clear and distinct.
2. **Finite**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
3. **Input/Output**: It should accept input and produce output.
4. **Feasible**: It should be possible to perform each step.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a way of writing algorithms using a mix of natural language and programming-like structure, without worrying about specific syntax.

### Example: Adding Two Numbers

```text
START
  DECLARE num1, num2, sum
  INPUT num1, num2
  sum = num1 + num2
  PRINT sum
END
```
