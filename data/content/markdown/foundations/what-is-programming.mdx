# What is Programming?

**Programming** is the art and science of instructing computers to perform tasks. It involves writing code—a sequence of instructions that machines can understand and execute.

## The Big Picture

```
Human Idea → Programming Language → Computer Execution
     ↓              ↓                     ↓
"Sort names"   sort(names)         01001010...
```

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Code** | Instructions written in a programming language | `print("Hello")` |
| **Source Code** | Human-readable code written by programmers | Python, JavaScript files |
| **Machine Code** | Binary (0s and 1s) that hardware executes | `01001010 11010010` |
| **Compiler** | Translates entire code to machine code at once | C, C++, Rust |
| **Interpreter** | Translates and executes code line by line | Python, JavaScript |
| **IDE** | Integrated Development Environment for coding | VS Code, PyCharm |

## How Programming Works

### 1. Write Code (Source Code)

```multi
[javascript]
// Human-readable JavaScript code
let name = "Alice";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

[python]
# Human-readable Python code
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

[java]
// Human-readable Java code
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Alice";
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}

[cpp]
// Human-readable C++ code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name = "Alice";
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Translation (Compile/Interpret)

```
Source Code → Compiler/Interpreter → Machine Code
```

### 3. Execution

The CPU reads machine code and performs operations:
- Store values in memory
- Perform calculations
- Display output

## Types of Programming Languages

### By Level of Abstraction

| Level | Description | Languages | Use Cases |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Low-level** | Close to hardware, complex | Assembly, Machine Code | OS kernels, drivers |
| **High-level** | Human-friendly, abstracted | Python, JavaScript, Java | Apps, websites, AI |

### By Execution Model

| Type | How It Works | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Compiled** | Entire code → machine code → run | C, C++, Rust, Go |
| **Interpreted** | Line by line execution | Python, JavaScript, Ruby |
| **Hybrid** | Compiles to bytecode → interpreted | Java, C# |

## Programming Paradigms

Different ways to organize and structure code:

| Paradigm | Description | Languages |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Procedural** | Step-by-step instructions | C, Pascal |
| **Object-Oriented** | Organize code into objects | Java, Python, C++ |
| **Functional** | Focus on pure functions | Haskell, Lisp |
| **Declarative** | Describe what, not how | SQL, HTML |

Most modern languages support multiple paradigms!

## Why Learn Programming?

### 1. Problem Solving
Programming teaches you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps—a skill valuable in any field.

### 2. Automation
Automate repetitive tasks:
```multi
[javascript]
// Instead of manually renaming 1000 files...
files.forEach((file, i) => {
    rename(file, `photo_${i}.jpg`);
});

[python]
# Instead of manually renaming 1000 files...
for i, file in enumerate(files):
    rename(file, f"photo_{i}.jpg")

[java]
// Instead of manually renaming 1000 files...
for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
    rename(files[i], "photo_" + i + ".jpg");
}

[cpp]
// Instead of manually renaming 1000 files...
for (int i = 0; i < files.size(); i++) {
    rename(files[i], "photo_" + to_string(i) + ".jpg");
}
```

### 3. Career Opportunities
- Software Developer
- Data Scientist
- Web Developer
- AI/ML Engineer
- DevOps Engineer

### 4. Creativity
Build anything: apps, games, websites, robots, AI models.

### 5. Understanding Technology
Know how the digital world works—essential in our tech-driven society.

## Your First Program

```multi
[javascript]
console.log("Hello, World!");

[python]
print("Hello, World!")

[java]
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

[cpp]
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## The Programming Workflow

```
1. Understand the Problem
       ↓
2. Plan the Solution (Algorithm)
       ↓
3. Write the Code
       ↓
4. Test & Debug
       ↓
5. Improve & Maintain
```

### Tips for Beginners

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic programs, build up
2. **Practice daily**: Even 30 minutes counts
3. **Read error messages**: They tell you what's wrong
4. **Don't memorize**: Understand concepts, look up syntax
5. **Build projects**: Apply what you learn
6. **Ask for help**: Stack Overflow, communities
